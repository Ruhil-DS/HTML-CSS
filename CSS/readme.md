In this particular assignment, i have used HTML5 along with CSS.
Here, I have created a student's profile with inter-linked pages, each showing a different information, with basic CSS applied to it.

The assignment was created according the intstructions provided to me which are under the PDF "Week2_LA_CSS.pdf"

There is a zip file by the name "21f2001180.zip" which contains all the files I have uploaded explicitly, to run the code for yourself.
